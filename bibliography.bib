  abstract = {We propose a framework to construct statistical arbitrage portfolios with graph clustering algorithms. First, we use various clustering methods to partition the correlation matrix of market residual returns of stocks into clusters. Next, we construct and evaluate the performance of mean-reverting statistical arbitrage portfolios within each cluster. We explore five clustering algorithms and demonstrate that our proposed framework generates profitable trading strategies with over 10\% annualized returns and statistically significant Sharpe ratios above one. The performance of our statistical arbitrage portfolios is neutral to the market and cannot be fully explained by intra-industry mean-reversion effects.},

  abstract = {Statistical arbitrage is a prevalent trading strategy which takes advantage of mean reverse property of spread of paired stocks. Studies on this strategy often rely heavily on model assumption. In this study, we introduce an innovative model-free and reinforcement learning based framework for statistical arbitrage. For the construction of mean reversion spreads, we establish an empirical reversion time metric and optimize asset coefficients by minimizing this empirical mean reversion time. In the trading phase, we employ a reinforcement learning framework to identify the optimal mean reversion strategy. Diverging from traditional mean reversion strategies that primarily focus on price deviations from a long-term mean, our methodology creatively constructs the state space to encapsulate the recent trends in price movements. Additionally, the reward function is carefully tailored to reflect the unique characteristics of mean reversion trading.},
